# The test address

Pressing 'test URL address' the button :

will generate an address (called URL) of the test. It represents a unique code referring to the location the test and the stimuli.

1. The first URL will load the initial loading screen of the test and its defined structure..
2. The second URL will load the defined structure of the test without the initial screen

The select URL can be copied into a clipboard (using the 'Copy to clipboard' button) and sent either by mail to the participants or tested locally in the browser.

{% hint style="info" %}
The URL address will render the test according to its structure in its most recently saved version. Please remember to save the edited version using the 'save' button.
{% endhint %}

### Shortening the test address

The test address contains the location of the test, the location of the results and the location of the stimuli to be loaded during the test. The address is therefore long. General services for shortening the address can be used such as:

* The BITLY service at [https://bitly.com](https://bitly.com) can be used to shorten long URL even sans registration (the url has a https://bit.ly/.... form)
