# Points in the picture (imagepoint, imagemultipoint)

If the stimuli is depicted as a picture, it can be used in these kinds of tasks:

* `imagemultipoint` will display a distinctly coloured button. More points can be selected on its press. The right button will remove the last point.
* `imagepoint` will display a differentiated coloured button. It can be pressed to select a point in the picture. The right button will remove the point.
